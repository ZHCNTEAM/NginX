W3Techs reports that 5.1% of the top 1 million sites on the web (according to Alexa) use nginx. Hence nginx is on the 3rd place after Apache (70.2%) and IIS (20.5%).

By the way, Netcraft reports similar 5.21% nginx share of the million busiest sites in July 2010.

Another survey by BuiltWith.com. It’s interesting that nginx is used rather on more loaded sites: 4.95% of the top 10,000 sites versus 3.14% of the top million (on July 27, 2010), while Apache is used more on less loaded sites: 63.60% of the top million sites versus 55.79% of the top 10,000 sites. IIS/6.0 is more preferred on middle range sites: 24.49% of the top 100,000 sites versus 20.05% of the top 10,000 and 21.15% of the top million.

Also two books about nginx have recently been published: “实战Nginx：取代Apache的高性能Web服务器” by 张宴 (Zhang Yan) in Chinese and “Nginx HTTP Server” by Clément Nedelcu in English.
